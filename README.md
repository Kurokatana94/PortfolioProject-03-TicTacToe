<h1>Simple Tic Tac Toe game</h1>

<p>You can play it in 2 modes:</p>
<p>Solo mode -> You vs AI (not machine learning, but simple logic behind the moves)</p>
<p>Duo mode -> You vs a second player (player1 chooses its symbol, then you play in turns)</p>
<p>-Playable as CLI-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all, but works none the less</p>
